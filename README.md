Java Video Encryptor using AES 128 Bit

JVE (Java Video Encryptor) is very simple Java Swing App that can be used to protect video file (.mp4 type only for now) with AES 128 Bit.

*On the future*, I will add more functionality, e.g :
- Multiple video formats
- More Chiper Algorithm 

Run **app.jar** to try it.
